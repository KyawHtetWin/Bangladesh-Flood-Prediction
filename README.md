# FloodGuard: Integrating Rainfall Time Series and GIS Data for Flood Prediction and Waterbody Forecasting in Bangladesh

## Project Overview
This repository is a collection of my contributions to a Bangladesh local chapter at Omdena working to build forecast models to assist the local flood management efforts [(Omdena Project Page)](https://omdena.com/chapter-challenges/floodguard-integrating-rainfall-time-series-and-gis-data-for-flood-prediction-and-waterbody-forecasting-in-bangladesh/).

## Contribution Summary

As the primary contributor, I have gathered relevant insights from GIS data to inform model development, performed flood classification modeling in Dhaka, and rainfall prediction in Rangpur while employing a variety of machine-learning techniques to address the project goal.

## Project Goals and Achievements

### GIS Data Exploration
- **Goal**: Analyze GIS data to identify high-risk flood areas in Bangladesh.
- **Achievement**: Provided insightful recommendations and visualizations of topological features influencing flood susceptibility.
- **Folder**: GIS High-risk Flood Areas Exploration

### Flood Prediction Modeling in Dhaka
- **Goal**: Develop a classification model to predict flood events in Dhaka based on spatial and temporal data.
- **Achievement**: Constructed a Random Forest model that effectively predicts flood events, with an emphasis on recall and Cohen Kappa Score.
- **Folder**: Dhaka  Flood Prediction Model

### Average Rainfall Prediction in Rangpur
- **Goal**: Forecast average daily rainfall in Rangpur using historical weather patterns.
- **Achievement**: Created an XGBoost regression model with fine-tuned hyperparameters, providing reliable rainfall predictions.
- **Folder**: Rangpur_Rainfall_Prediction

### Key Technologies
- Geographic Information System (GIS)
- Python for data analysis and machine learning
- XGBoost and Random Forest for predictive modeling
- Streamlit for deploying interactive web applications

## Future Directions
Each project within this repository holds potential for expansion and refinement. Future work involves enhancing data collection methodologies, integrating more complex features, and improving model robustness against extreme weather events.
