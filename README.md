# FloodGuard: Integrating Rainfall Time Series and GIS Data for Flood Prediction and Waterbody Forecasting in Bangladesh

## Project Overview
This repository is a collection of my contributions aimed at developing predictive models to assist flood prediction in Bangladesh. [Omdena Project Link](https://omdena.com/chapter-challenges/floodguard-integrating-rainfall-time-series-and-gis-data-for-flood-prediction-and-waterbody-forecasting-in-bangladesh/)
The models span two major cities, Dhaka and Rangpur, focusing on flood prediction and rainfall forecasting respectively.

## Contribution Summary

As the primary contributor, I have gathered relevant insights from GIS data to inform model development, performed flood classification modeling in Dhaka, and rainfall prediction in Rangpur,
employing a variety of machine-learning techniques to address the issue of floods in Bangladesh.

## Project Goals and Achievements

### GIS Data Exploration
- **Goal**: Analyze GIS data to identify high-risk flood areas in Bangladesh.
- **Achievement**: Provided insightful recommendations and visualizations of topological features influencing flood susceptibility.
- **Folder**: [GIS Data Exploration](./GIS-Data-Exploration)

### Flood Prediction Modeling in Dhaka
- **Goal**: Develop a classification model to predict flood events in Dhaka based on spatial and temporal data.
- **Achievement**: Constructed a Random Forest model that effectively predicts flood events, with an emphasis on recall and Cohen Kappa Score.
- **Folder**: [Flood Prediction Dhaka](./Flood-Prediction-Dhaka)

### Average Rainfall Prediction in Rangpur
- **Goal**: Forecast average daily rainfall in Rangpur using historical weather patterns.
- **Achievement**: Created an XGBoost regression model with fine-tuned hyperparameters, providing reliable rainfall predictions.
- **Folder**: [Rainfall Prediction Rangpur](./Rainfall-Prediction-Rangpur)

### Key Technologies
