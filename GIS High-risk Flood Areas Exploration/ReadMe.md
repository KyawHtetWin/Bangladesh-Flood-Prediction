# GIS Data Exploration for Flood Prediction in Bangladesh

## Contribution

As a key member of the data team, I explored various GIS datasets to gain insights into areas at high risk of flooding in Bangladesh. My work involved detailed analysis and visualization, leading to actionable recommendations informing the model development downstream.

## Key Data Insights

### 1. Elevation Data Analysis (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission - SRTM)
- **Objective**: To identify flood-prone areas based on elevation.
- **Key Insights**:
    - The majority of Bangladesh's terrain is flat, with 95% below 100 meters.
    - Areas at or below the 50th percentile elevation are most susceptible to flooding.

### 2. Land Use Data Exploration (Dynamic World Land Cover)
- **Objective**: To understand the relationship between land use patterns and flood risk.
- **Key Insights**:
    - Extensive water bodies present across Bangladesh.
    - Limited forested areas, raising questions about land use impact on flooding.
    - Identified flooded vegetation areas as particularly vulnerable.

### 3. Land Surface Temperature (Night-time Analysis)
- **Objective**: To explore temperature patterns and their implications on flooding.
- **Key Findings**: 
    - Night-time land surface temperature follows a normal distribution, offering insights into environmental conditions preceding flood events.

### 4. Sand & Soil Water Content Comparison by District
- **Objective**: To evaluate soil conditions that contribute to flood risk.
- **Key Recommendations**:
    - Identified districts with high soil saturation, indicating increased flood risk.
    - Recommended integrating elevation data for a comprehensive understanding of rainfall-runoff impacts.
    - Suggested considering land use/cover in correlation with soil and elevation data to assess flood risk accurately.

## Conclusion
The analyses conducted provide crucial insights into the environmental factors contributing to flooding in Bangladesh. These findings are instrumental in guiding the development of a predictive model for flood occurrence, which is vital for disaster preparedness and management in the region.
